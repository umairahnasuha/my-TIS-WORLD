💻 Lab Session: Computer Disassembly & Assembly
---

During this lab session, we learned how to carefully disassemble and assemble a desktop computer, gaining hands-on experience with internal components. As a girl, I am rarely exposed to hardware tasks like this, so it was exciting to step out of my comfort zone and explore something new.

We practiced:
---

- Removing and reconnecting RAM, hard disk, power supply, and CPU cooling fan.
- Properly handling internal cables and components to avoid damage.
- Following the correct sequence for disassembly and assembly to ensure the system functions properly.

💡 Key Takeaways
---
- Focus during the lecturer’s instructions is essential to perform the tasks safely and accurately.
- Hands-on learning makes technical concepts more understandable and enjoyable.
- Experimenting with hardware boosted my confidence and motivation to explore ICT and technical skills further.
- Even tasks that seem uncommon or challenging can be fun and rewarding with curiosity and attention.
- This session was both educational and enjoyable, showing that practical experience is invaluable in understanding how computers work and building confidence in technical skills.
