   - Enhance collaboration among team members

## 💡 Reflection
This open day was a meaningful and enjoyable experience 👍🏻, as it allowed my teammates and me to learn beyond the classroom and gain exposure to real-world professional practices. Attending the event with friends made the experience even more memorable, filled with discussions, laughter, and valuable insights into teamwork and work culture 👩🏻‍💻.

During the visit, we gained a brief yet valuable introduction to Project Management using the Agile Scrum framework, including how sprints, teamwork, continuous improvement, and proper timeline planning contribute to smooth development, testing, and deployment. Overall, it was a fun and insightful learning experience 🕵🏻‍♀️.

Experiences like this help broaden my perspective, boost motivation, and inspire me to continue learning and improving myself ✨. I am truly grateful for the opportunity and for the friends who made this journey both educational and enjoyable. A day well spent and a memory to cherish 💫.
