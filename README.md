🌍✨ Welcome to TIS WORLD ✨🌍

TIS WORLD is a personal space where I share my journey 📘, learning experiences 💡, and reflections ✍️ throughout the Technology & Information Systems (TIS) subject.

Through this subject, I have explored how technology 💻 and information systems 🌐 are designed, managed, and applied to solve real-world problems 🌱. From understanding basic concepts to applying design thinking 🎨, teamwork 🤝, and problem-solving skills 🧠, every activity in TIS has helped me grow both academically 🎓 and personally 🌟.

What makes this subject truly fun 😄 is the interactive projects 🚀, creative thinking process 💭, and group discussions 🗣️. I enjoyed brainstorming ideas 🧩, designing digital solutions 📱, and seeing how technology can positively impact society 🌍💙.
