# Digital Solutions for the Autism & ADHD Community ✨💻🧩

This project explores a non-functional prototype of a digital system designed to support individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) 🧩 and ADHD ⚡, as well as their parents 👪, caregivers 🧑‍⚕️, teachers 👩‍🏫, and therapists 🩺. The system focuses on improving daily living 🏠, learning 📚, communication 💬, therapy 🧘, and health monitoring ❤️ through empathetic and user-friendly interface design. Screens include login 🔑, module navigation 📂, and output flow 📊, highlighting intuitive navigation and accessibility ♿. No coding or backend is implemented—our goal is problem-solving through design thinking 💡.

On early December 🗓️, we began by brainstorming ideas 💭 and proposing them to Dr. Azurah 👩‍🏫 to gather feedback. After making necessary corrections ✅ and receiving approval, we proceeded to design a non-functional prototype of a digital system supporting individuals with ASD and ADHD, along with their parents, caregivers, teachers, and therapists. The system aims to enhance daily living 🏠, learning 📚, communication 💬, therapy 🧘, and health monitoring ❤️ through empathetic, user-friendly interface design. Screens include login 🔑, module navigation 📂, and output flow 📊, emphasizing accessibility ♿ and intuitive navigation 🧭. No coding or backend is implemented—our focus is problem-solving through design thinking 💡.

## My Reflection
Working on this project allowed me to step into the shoes of autistic and ADHD individuals and their caregivers, understanding the daily challenges they face. Designing a non-functional prototype challenged me to prioritize usability, accessibility, and empathy over technical coding. I learned the importance of clear navigation, visual clarity, and supportive features that make technology inclusive. This experience deepened my appreciation for human-centered design and reinforced that impactful solutions start with understanding real-world needs.
